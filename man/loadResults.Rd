\title{Load ThreeME results from a csv exported by EViews
Note that the csv files must be located in the csv/ directory,
baseline results should be indexed by '_0' and scenario results by '_2',
and that all scenarios must share the same baseline}

}
\arguments{
\item{scenarios}{Name of the scenario csv files (with or without a csv extension)}

\item{by_commodity}{TRUE if variables should be aggregated by commodity where applicable and given a specified bridge. (FALSE by default)}

\item{by_sector}{TRUE if variables should be aggregated by sector where applicable and given a specified bridge. (FALSE by default)}

\item{bridge_c}{bridge for commodities to be used if aggregation by commodity is requested. A bridge is a list of vectors. The names specify the larger aggregation group, and the elements of the vectors are the commodity codes that belong in this larger group.}

\item{bridge_s}{bridge for sector to be used if aggregation by sector is requested. A bridge is a list of vectors. The names specify the larger aggregation group, and the elements of the vectors are the sector codes that belong in this larger group.}

\item{names_s}{a data.frame used only if no aggregation is requested for sectors. One column "code" should contain the codes used in the sector variables and a column "name" contains the explicit name.}

\item{names_c}{a data.frame used only if no aggregation is requested for commodities. One column "code" should contain the codes used in the commodity variables and a column "name" contains the explicit name.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following columns:
 - variable: name of the ThreeME variable for which the result is reported in a given row
 - year: year for which the result is reported in a given row
 - one column per scenario, named after the scenario (e.g. "baseline") containing
 the values of the results themselves
 - sector : if applicable, the sector name pertaining to the variable, NA otherwise
 - commodity : if applicable, the commodity name pertaining to the variable, NA otherwise
