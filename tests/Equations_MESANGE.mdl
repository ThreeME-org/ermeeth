##! Price of imported commodity $c$, expressed at basic price
PM[c]        = EXR * PWD[c]

##! Market price of domestically produced households final consumption $c$

##! Capacity utilization ratio of the sector $s$

#### Trade inter

##! Foreign demand for exports of commodity $c$

##! Notional substitution effect induced by a change in the relative price between export prices and (converted in domestic currency) international prices for the commodity $c$
d(SUBST_X_n[c]) = -ES_X[c] * d(log(PX[c]) - log(EXR * PWD[c]))                     if X[c]               <> 0
